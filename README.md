# flask_court_form_maker
Uses Python and Flask to take user input from browser to create court forms and pleadings. It runs in a browser window if you
run it locally at localhost:5000. The requirements txt file shows the required python modules and versions you should install
before running. The file is formatted for putting it on heroku, although you could also run it on App Engine or AWS. Your
mileage may vary.
